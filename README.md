# Artificial-Neural-Network-Tutorial-MLP-and-CNN-implementation
A from-scratch implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks using NumPy, with a GPU-accelerated PyTorch version for comparison. Covers forward/backpropagation, SGD, ReLU, softmax, convolution, and max pooling, applied to 1D regression, binary classification, and the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.
